    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a YANG data model for the management of the
      Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). It extends the basic ARP
      functionality contained in the ietf-ip YANG data model, defined in RFC
      8344, to provide management of optional ARP features and statistics.</t>

      <t>The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network
      Management Datastore Architecture defined in RFC 8342.</t>

      <t>Basic ARP functionality is supported by the ietf-ip YANG data model,

      also cover optional ARP features, and ARP related statistics to aid
      network monitoring and troubleshooting.</t>

      <t>This model defines YANG configuration and operational state data

    <!-- intro -->

    <section anchor="problem" title="Problem Statement">
      <t>Neither ARP <xref target="RFC0826"/>, nor Proxy-ARP <xref
      target="RFC1027"/>, define standard network management configuration
      models. Instead, network equipment vendors have implemented their own
      bespoke configuration interfaces and models.</t>

      <t>Network operators benefit from having common network management
      models defined that can be implemented by multiple network equipment
      manufacturers. This simplifies the operation and management of network
      devices.</t>

      <t>Some, but not all, required ARP functionality has been defined in
      ietf-ip.yang (<xref target="RFC8344"/>). Providing a standard YANG model
      that models these optional ARP features, that are fairly widely
      implemented by network equipment manufacturers , and used by network
      operators, is beneficial to the general goal of interoperability in the
      networking industry.</t>

      <!-- Some of this should move to the design section ...
	  <t>This document defines a YANG <xref
      target="RFC7950"/> configuration data model that may be used to
      configure the ARP feature running on a system. Data model
      "ietf-ip" <xref target="RFC8344"/> covers the address mapping
      functionality. However, this functionality is strictly dependent
      on IPv4 networks, and many ARP related functionalities are
      missing, e.g.  device global ARP entries and control,
      configuration related to dynamic ARP learning, proxy ARP,
      gratuitous ARP, etc.</t>

      <t>The data model makes use of the YANG "feature" construct which allows
      implementations to support only those ARP features that lie within their
      capabilities. It is intended this model be used by service providers who
      manipulate devices from different vendors in a standard way.</t>

      <t>This model can be used to configure the ARP applications for
      discovering the link layer address associated with a given Internet
      layer address.</t> -->
    </section>

    <!-- problem -->

    <section anchor="design" title="Design of the Data Model">
      <t>This data model intends to describe the processing that a protocol
      finds the hardware address, also known as Media Access Control (MAC)
      address, of a host from its known IP address. These tasks include, but
      are not limited to, configuring dynamic ARP learning, proxy ARP,
      gratuitous ARP. There are two kind of ARP configurations: global ARP
      configuration, which is across all interfaces on the device, and per
      interface ARP configuration.</t>

      <section title="ARP Dynamic Learning">
        <t>As defined in <xref target="RFC0826"/>, ARP caching is the method of
        storing network addresses and the associated data-link addresses in
        memory for a period of time as the addresses are learned. This
        minimizes the use of valuable network resources to broadcast for the
        same address each time a datagram is sent.</t>

        <t>There are static ARP cache entries and dynamic ARP cache entries.
        Static entries, are manually configured and kept in the cache table 
        on a permanent basis which are defined in the ipv4 neighbor list for
        each interface in <xref target="RFC8344"/>. Dynamic entries are added
        by vendor software, kept for a period of time, and then removed. 
        We can specify how long an entry remains in the ARP cache. If we 
        specify a timeout of 0 seconds, entries are never cleared from the 
        ARP cache.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Proxy ARP">
        <t>Proxy ARP, defined in <xref target="RFC1027"/>, allows a router to
        respond to ARP requests on behalf of another machine that is not on
        the same local subnet, offering its own Ethernet media access control
        (MAC) address. By replying in such a way, the router then takes
        responsibility for routing packets to the intended destination.</t>

        <t>In the case of certain data center network virtualization, as
        specified in <xref target="RFC8014"/>, the proxy ARP can
        be extended to intercept all ARP requests, including source and target
        IP addresses in different subnets, and those ARP requests in the same
        subnet to suppress ARP handling.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Gratuitous ARP">
        <t>Gratuitous ARP enables a device to send an ARP Request packet using
        its own IP address as the destination address. Gratuitous ARP provides
        the following functions:<list style="symbols">
            <t>Checks duplicate IP addresses: <xref target="RFC5227"/> uses
            gratuitous ARP to help detect IP conflicts. When a device receives
            an ARP request containing a source IP that matches its own, then
            it knows there is an IP conflict. </t>

            <t>Advertises a new MAC address: Also in RFC 5227, if the MAC
            address of a host changes because its network adapter is replaced,
            the host sends a gratuitous ARP packet to notify all hosts of the
            change before the ARP entry is aged out.</t>

            <t>Notifies an active/standby switchover in a <xref
            target="RFC5798"/> VRRP backup group: After an active/standby
            switchover, the master router sends a gratuitous ARP packet in the
            VRRP backup group to notify the switchover.</t>
          </list></t>

      <t>The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
      that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such as
      NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> or RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/> .
      The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer, and the
      mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) <xref
      target="RFC6242"/>. The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the
      mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS <xref
      target="RFC8446"/>.</t>

      <t>The NETCONF access control model <xref target="RFC8341"/> provides
      the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to
      a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
      operations and content..</t>

      <t>There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
      writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the default).
      These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
      network environments. Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these data
      nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on network
      operations.These are the subtrees and data nodes and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>
